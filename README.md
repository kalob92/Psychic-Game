# Psychic-Game

### Basics

* *Press any key A-Z to begin*
    * If you guessed the same letter as the computer, then you win
    * If you guess the wrong letter, you get **9** more guesses
    * If you run out of guesses, then you lose and the game restarts
    * **The game will not record any key inputs outside of the alphabet**


*the console should log each win, loss, number of guesses remaining, as well as what letter the computer already has in mind*
