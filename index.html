<!-- <h1> header "The Psychic Game" -->

<!-- Next is "Guess what letter I'm thinking of" -->

<!-- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly) -->
<!-- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly) -->
<!-- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update) -->
<!-- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.) -->
<!-- When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). -->
<!-- When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins) -->
